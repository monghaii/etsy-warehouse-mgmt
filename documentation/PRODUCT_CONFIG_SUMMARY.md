## üîÑ How It Works

### Order Import Flow

1. Orders are synced from Etsy
2. Each order contains a `product_sku` field
3. System tracks all unique SKUs

### SKU Detection

1. API scans all orders for unique SKUs
2. Compares against configured products in `product_templates`
3. Returns list of unconfigured SKUs

### Product Configuration

1. Admin configures product for each SKU
2. Settings are stored in `product_templates` table
3. Future orders with that SKU will use this configuration

### Phase 2 Integration (Next)

1. Enrichment form will read product configuration
2. Display appropriate input fields based on `personalization_type`
3. Show `personalization_notes` to guide customers
4. Use dimensions/weight for shipping calculations

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Added Columns to `product_templates`

```sql
personalization_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'none'
  -- Options: 'none', 'notes', 'image', 'both'

personalization_notes TEXT
  -- Instructions for the personalization field
```

### Example Product Record

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "sku": "BLANKET-10X10",
  "product_name": "10x10 Fleece Blanket",
  "category": "Blankets",
  "personalization_type": "both",

  "default_length_inches": 10,
  "default_width_inches": 10,
  "default_height_inches": 1,
  "default_weight_oz": 16,
  "sla_business_days": 5,
  "canva_template_id": "ABC123",
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2025-10-27T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-27T00:00:00Z"

## üéØ What's Next: Phase 2 - Enrichment

With product configuration complete, you're ready to begin Phase 2:

1. **Public Enrichment Form** - Uses product configuration to display appropriate fields
2. **File Upload** - For products with `personalization_type: 'image'` or `'both'`
3. **Order Validation** - Ensures order numbers are valid
4. **Flag for Review** - Handle problematic enrichments

The product configuration system provides the foundation for the enrichment form to know:

- What type of personalization to collect
- What instructions to show customers
- What fields to display (text, image, or both)

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the migration ran successfully
2. Verify you're logged in as an admin
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Review `documentation/PRODUCT_CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed API docs
